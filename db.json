This is a lovely read about a writer who lives in an isolated Scottish home in summer. This is not a book of fast plot or twists, but it is equisite description of the home and life there, and of how life changes when the writer acquires a pet otter. With sophisticated writing and vocabulary, even the fawning over this beloved otter avoids sentimentality or cuteness, and sustains a literary tone that is beautiful and rewarding.",

It was one of those books I felt kind of like showering after I finished reading it to get the yuck off me. However, I enjoyed The Girl on the Train. As someone else said, the characters (some, not all) are more sympathetic. It was fast-paced and had a decent ending.",
